Is 'Deadpool 3 & Wolverine' Streaming?

No, Deadpool 3 & Wolverine is not currently available to stream. At least, not yet. As soon as Wade and Logan are finishing their slashing spree on the big screen, the film will more than likely follow suit with the other MCU projects and X-Men and become available to stream on Disney+. However, since Deadpool 3 & Wolverine is Marvel Studios' first-ever R-rated feature, there is a decent chance that the movie could be released simultaneously on Hulu. A simultaneous release on Disney+ and Hulu is what Marvel Studios decided to do with their first TV-MA-rated series, Echo.

What Is the Release Date for 'Deadpool 3 & Wolverine'?

Wade and Logan's quest to save the multiverse begins when Deadpool 3 & Wolverine officially premieres in the United States and Canada on Friday, July 26, 2024. However, some parts of the globe will get to see this historic anti-hero union a few days earlier, depending on which country you call home.

The release of Deadpool 3 & Wolverine may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day.

However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady Deadpool (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.
